                Rooted in Legacy, Built for the Future: The Story of Burgess Group <br><br>
                Burgess Group’s roots trace back to June 29, 1974, when Albert “Buddy” Layton Lee was licensed as a mechanical contractor in North Carolina. This license, number 6595, is still proudly used today. Albert, a master of mechanical and piping systems, operated the company for over 30 years, earning the nickname “The Gas Man” for his expertise. Albert's journey in construction began early, working alongside his family in a depression-era sawmill and helping excavate the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. After serving in the Pacific during World War II, he honed his skills in various mechanical roles. In 1954, he joined his uncle J.T. Lee’s business in Wilmington, eventually managing operations in Clinton, NC, before founding his own mechanical contracting firm in 1974.

                    Charles Funderburk began his welding career in 1963 at the age of 16, working alongside his father, Leroy, a renowned welder involved in iconic projects like the St. Louis Arch. Leroy, a member of the Pine Bluff, Arkansas Local 665 Union, passed on his expertise to Charles, who joined the union before finishing high school. Upon graduation, Charles began welding at the International Paper Plant in Monroe, Louisiana, and soon moved on to his first power plant construction at the Lake Catherine Plant in Malvern, Arkansas.

                    At 20, Charles advanced to Arkansas Nuclear One in Russellville, Arkansas, where he specialized in code welding materials like Stainless, Inconel, and Hastelloy.

                    Throughout the 1970s and 80s, he worked on major power plant projects across the U.S., from California to the Carolinas. A highlight of his career came in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he was selected from over 2,000 welders to repair cracked nuclear reactor piping. In 1983, he took his first non-union role with an oil services company in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.

                    In 1985, Charles returned to found Motion Welding Service, providing welding and piping expertise to over 30 major contractors nationwide. This legacy culminated in 1999 when he merged with Burgess Group.

                    Today, Charles’ legacy continues through his sons: Charles Ed, a custom home builder in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Scott, a project manager on the Alaska pipeline.

                Vince Burgess, grandson of Albert Lee, grew up immersed in the family business. Following in his grandfather's footsteps, Vince received his North Carolina Plumbing and Heating License in 1993 and went on to manage large-scale projects across the U.S. for some of the nation’s top contractors. In 1998, he founded the first Burgess Group company and later merged with Motion Welding Service in 1999. After his grandfather’s passing in 2004, Vince integrated Albert’s mechanical company into Burgess Group. Guided by the wisdom of Lee and Funderburk, Vince has led the company to national prominence, completing major industrial and commercial projects across the U.S., including Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Burgess Group's clients include government agencies, global corporations, and leading contractors.
